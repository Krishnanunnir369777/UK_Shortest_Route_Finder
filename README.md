UK Shortest Route Finder

An interactive Streamlit web app that finds and visualizes the shortest travel path between two UK cities using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
It calculates real-world distances between cities with Geopy and displays the route on an interactive Plotly Mapbox map.

🚀 Features

🗺️ Select any two UK cities

📏 Adjust max connection distance (km)

⚙️ Calculates the shortest path using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

📍 Displays route and total distance

🌍 Interactive map visualization

🧠 Tech Stack

Python, Streamlit, Plotly, Geopy, NumPy, Pandas
